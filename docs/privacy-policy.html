  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">The Loop &mdash; Last updated February 23, 2026</p>

  <p>
    The Loop is a golf tee time aggregator for public courses in Utah. We take your privacy
    seriously. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.
  </p>

  <hr class="divider" />

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The Loop does not require an account to use. We do not collect your name, email address,
    phone number, or any personally identifiable information.
  </p>
  <p>The only data that may be transmitted when using the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Caddy Bot chat messages:</strong> If you use the AI chat feature, your message text
      is sent to our backend (Supabase) and then to OpenAI to generate a response. We do not
      store your chat messages beyond the active session. OpenAI may retain messages in accordance
      with their own <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Anonymous usage data:</strong> Standard mobile analytics (crash reports, session
      counts) may be collected by Expo/React Native infrastructure. This data is not linked to
      any individual user.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email, or any account credentials.</li>
    <li>We do not track your location.</li>
    <li>We do not share any data with third-party advertisers.</li>
    <li>We do not store payment information. All booking is handled directly by the golf course.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Tee Time Data</h2>
  <p>
    The Loop aggregates publicly available tee time information from golf course booking systems.
    This data is used solely to display availability within the app. We do not store any user
    interaction with tee time listings.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you tap "Book" on a tee time, you are redirected to the golf course's own booking website.
    We have no control over and are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third-party
    websites.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Loop is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
    information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information,
    please contact us and we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use industry-standard security practices to protect any data transmitted through the app,
    including HTTPS encryption for all network requests. Because we collect minimal data, there
    is minimal risk of a data breach affecting you personally.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted at this URL
    with an updated "last modified" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes
    acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
