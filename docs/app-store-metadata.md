## Subtitle (30 chars max)
Utah Tee Times, No Waiting

## Description (4000 chars max)
No tee box is off limits.

The Loop is a tee time aggregator built for Utah's public golfer. Instead of refreshing five different booking websites, The Loop pulls available tee times from courses across Salt Lake, Davis, Weber, Utah, and Washington counties — and surfaces them in one clean search.

**Search by what matters**
Filter by date, player count, time of day, and area. Results update every 20 minutes so what you see is what's actually available.

**Ask Caddy Bot**
Not sure where to play? Caddy Bot is an AI assistant that understands plain English. Tell it what you're looking for — budget, county, number of players, morning or afternoon — and it'll tell you what's open.

"Under $40 in Salt Lake, 2 players, Saturday morning."

That's all it takes.

**Course browser**
Browse all 30+ courses in the catalog, see availability across the next two weeks, and tap straight through to book.

**Built for Utah**
Every course in The Loop is a Utah public course. No private clubs, no velvet ropes, no gatekeeping. Just more access, more intention, and more time on the course.
